# Triple Peaks Coffee Shop

This is the second project of the Software Engineering program at TripleTen. It was created using HTML and CSS, based on the design brief.

## Project features

- Semantic HTML5
- Flexbox
- Positioning
- Flat BEM file structure
- A custom form
- CSS animation and transform

## Plan on improving the project

Working on this project made me touched into my artistic side on how I can visually make a website better without making it seem very overwhelming.

Add your ideas here: 
- Could change the fonts used and the font sizing, especially in the menu section. It looks a little plain and boring.

- Would add an animation to the nav link (A bar transitionally showing up underneath it when hovered)
